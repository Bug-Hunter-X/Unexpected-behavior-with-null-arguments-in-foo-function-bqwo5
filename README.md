# Unexpected Null Handling in foo Function

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to unexpected behavior when null values are passed as arguments to a function. The `foo` function in `bug.js` does not handle null values properly, leading to premature function termination.

## Problem

The `foo` function immediately returns when either `a` or `b` is null. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the rest of the function's logic relies on `a` and `b` having valid values.  This behavior may not be immediately apparent and can cause difficult-to-debug issues in larger applications.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution where explicit checks for null values are performed and alternate behavior is implemented. This ensures that the function handles null values gracefully, preventing abrupt termination and enhancing the robustness of the code. The solution demonstrates a more robust way to handle potential null values, enhancing the function's reliability.
